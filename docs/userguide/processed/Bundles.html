<div class="pagetitle">Bundles</div>
<p>Bundles let you save a quick "snapshot" of McIDAS-V, including data sources,
  maps, and data displays. Bundles are small information files that specify the
  state of McIDAS-V. They are a kind of configuration file. They include information
  about what data sources are in use, and which parameters from the data sources
  are displayed, and how they are displayed.</p>
<p>The purpose of bundles is for you to save a particular McIDAS-V setup and
  display. A bundle can be used for your own reference at a later time, or others
  using McIDAS-V can use bundles you made to see data the same way you did.</p>
<div class="pagesubtitle">Saving a Bundle</div>
<p>To make a new bundle file, select the <strong>File-&gt;Save Bundle </strong> menu item in the Main Display window.
  A pop-up window will let you set a new file location and name:</p>
<a name="image1" id="image1"></a>
<div class="images"><img src="images/FileDialog.gif" alt="Image 1: Bundle File Dialog"> <br>
  <span class="caption">Image 1: Save Bundle Dialog</span></div>
<p>The customary McIDAS-V bundle filename extension is <strong>.mcv</strong>;
  if you do not enter a file extension, .mcv will be appended. When saving a
  .mcv file, no data is saved with the bundle, only references to the remote
  or local Data Sources are saved. </p>
<p>McIDAS-V does support a zipped data bundle format:<strong> .mcvz</strong>. This is a zip file
  that contains a regular bundle (.mcv) and a set of data files. When the user
  does a "Save Bundle&quot; or &quot;Save Favorite " and specifies a .mcvz file
  extension, McIDAS-V prompts the user to select the data sources that should
  be written into the zip file. When opening a .mcvz file, McIDAS-V needs to
  unzip the data files, so it prompts the user as to where to place the files
  - a temporary directory or a user selected directory (this is a preference
  as well).</p>
<blockquote>Note: In order for bundle files to work, the data must be available in exactly
    the same way you made connection to it when you made the bundle file. Others
    who use your bundles must have access to the same file system or to the same
    remote or local data servers you use, so that file paths or URLs to the data
    are exactly the same.</blockquote>
<p>The file dialog has a set of buttons to define how parts of your bundle is
  saved.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <strong>Jython</strong> menu allows you to save the Jython code you
    may have in your library in different ways. For example, you may have written
    some custom Jython code that implements a Formula. You have a display that
    uses the results of that computation. To include your local Jython code just
    select <strong>All Jython</strong> or <strong>Selected Jython</strong>. When
    loading in a bundle that has had Jython code saved with it, the user will
    be prompted for what to do with the Jython.</li>
  <li><a name="relative" id="relative"></a> One can save a bundle with data paths
    that are relative to where the bundle is loaded from by checking the <strong>Save
    with relative paths</strong> checkbox. McIDAS-V will change the file based
    data sources to point to the directory where the bundle is loaded from. For
    example, you can use this to save a bundle that references model files on
    disk. Copy the bundle and the model files over to a thumb drive or CD. Then
    when you load the bundle the files are relative to the bundle path.
    <!--<div class="pagesubtitle">JNLP Bundles</div>
You can also save a bundle inside a &quot;jnlp file&quot; that can be used to
start McIDAS-V with the bundle. Use a filename extension of &quot;.jnlp&quot; in
place of .xidv. This file, when used as a link on a regular web page, allows
McIDAS-V users to start McIDAS-V with Web Start on their system with your bundle.
Click on the link to your jnlp file. McIDAS-V will start with the bundle you
saved in the .jnlp file.-->
    </li>
</ul>

<div class="pagesubtitle"><a name="favorites" id="favorites"></a>Saving a Bundle as a Favorite </div>
<p>Favorite bundles are just normal bundles that are categorized and saved off
  in a particular location on disk and serve as a convenience to the user. This
  allows the user to organize their favorites by category and readily load them
  in. Favorite bundles are easily available through the Bundles menu and can
  also be displayed on the toolbar of the Main Display window.</p>
<p>A favorite bundle can be created through the <strong>File-&gt;Save</strong><strong>
    Favorite...</strong> menu item in the Main Display window:</p>
<a name="image2" id="image2"></a>
<div class="images"><img src="images/SaveAsFavorite.gif" alt="Image 2: Save As Favorite Dialog"> <br>
  <span class="caption">Image 2: Save As Favorite Dialog</span></div>
<p>Define your favorite bundle by specifying a category
  in the <strong>Category</strong> field and a name in the <strong>Name</strong> field.
  Categories can be hierarchical; by using a "&gt;" as a separator (e.g. <em>Toolbar&gt;sounding</em>)
  the categories will appear as a tree structure in the Local Favorites Bundles
  Manager. The "Toolbar" category
  is a special category in the Favorite Bundles Manager. The bundles in the Toolbar
  category will also appear as links in the toolbar of your Main Display window.</p>
  <a name="localfav" id="localfav"></a>
<p>The Local Favorite Bundles Manager, accessed
  through the <strong>Bundles-&gt;Manage... </strong>menu item in the Main Display window, allows
  you to reorganize the categories and favorites by drag-and-drop, or right
  click on a favorite or a category to delete it, export it, etc.:</p>
<a name="image3" id="image3"></a>
<div class="images"><img src="images/FavoritesManager.gif" width="307" height="443" alt="Image 3: Local Favorite Bundles Manager"><br>
  <span class="caption">Image 3: Local Favorite Bundles Manager</span></div>
<p>Once a bundle has been saved as a favorite, it can be set as your default bundle that will load automatically when you start McIDAS-V. You can set a default bundle in the <strong><a href="tools/preferences/AdvancedPreferences.html#defaultbundle">Advanced</a></strong> tab of the User Preferences window. Note that after saving a favorite bundle, you must restart McIDAS-V before the bundle will be visible in the User Preferences window.</p>
<p>The <strong>Show McIDAS-V system bundles</strong> checkbox at the bottom of the window sets the visibility of the <strong>Current WX</strong> bundles on the <a href="ui/MainToolBar.html">Main Toolbar</a>. This option is turned on by default. The visibility of the system bundles can also be set in the <a href="tools/preferences/GeneralPreferences.html#systemBundles"><strong>General</strong></a> tab of the User Preferences window.</p>
<div class="pagesubtitle">Opening a Bundle</div>
<a name="open" id="open"></a>
<p>Use the <strong>File-&gt;Open File</strong> menu item in the Main Display window to open a bundle. When loading
in a new bundle you will be prompted whether the current displays and data should
be removed. You can also start up McIDAS-V with a bundle file or URL in the command
line.</p>
<a name="zidv" id="zidv"></a>
<div class="pagesubtitle">Copying Data Locally </div>
<p>For most remote data types, data can be copied from the server to the local
  disk using the "Make Remote Data Local" facility. The following ADDE types
  are supported: satellite, radar, point, sounding and forecast fronts. There
is also preliminary support for grids on remote servers<sup>*</sup> (see below).</p>
<p>This is used in two ways. First, the user can right-click on a data source
  in the <strong>Field Selector</strong> and select "Make Data Local" for remote data sources.
  McIDAS-V prompts for a file directory and a file prefix (the default is to
  use the name of the data source) and the remote data is copied over. For multiple
  files the format used is: &lt;directory&gt;&lt;prefix&gt;&lt;file count&gt;.&lt;suffix&gt;.
  The data source object within McIDAS-V is then changed to point to the new
  file paths.</p>
<p>The second way this is used is when a .mcvz file is saved. The user is prompted
  for both the local data sources to be saved off as well as for the remote data
  sources. For the remote ones, McIDAS-V automatically copies the files over
  and zips them.</p>
<p><strong><sup>*</sup>Grids:</strong> There is preliminary support for grids.
  This support relies on some extra service information in the catalogs which,
  right at this moment, is not included in the regular IDV gridded data catalog
  but is included for model data under the "File_Access" dataset in the main
  thredds catalog: http://www.ssec.wisc.edu/mcidas/software/v/threddsRTModels.xml When
  saving gridded data the user is prompted for the fields to save and the geo-spatial
  subset is used to subset the grids. As of right now, there is not yet support
  for sub-setting on times and grid stride/decimation.</p>
<div class="pagesubtitle">IDV Bundles</div>
<p>McIDAS-V has the ability to load  IDV bundles (.xidv and .zidv), but
  all of the features between the two software packages may not be compatible,
  and therefore the bundles may not load properly in the other software package.</p>
