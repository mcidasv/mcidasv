Building a new release
----------------------
Make sure IDV is up to date, then build the "dist" target:

    ant dist
    
Run Install4J and build the installer packages.

Nightlies
---------
A cron job that builds the "nightly" target runs daily at 4am:

    ant nightly
    
There is a separate script on the webserver that pulls the completed build.
